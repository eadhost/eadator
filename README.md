EAD2002 (DTD or XSD) universal validator

EAD2002 has a DTD version and an XSD version which are not compatible.  Firstly, they are in
different namespaces.  The DTD version is in the default xml namespace, and the XSD 
version is in {urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9}.  There are other minor differences in namespaces
and camel case.

This utility performs a universial EAD2002 validation.  It exits 0/success with no output if the 
file is a valid EAD2002.  It exits 1/failure with relevent validation error messages if the file
is not valid with respect to its intended type (XSD or DTD).
