EAD2002 (DTD or XSD) universal validator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eadhost/eadator.png)](https://travis-ci.org/eadhost/eadator) tested on python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, pypy 

travis no longer tests python 2.5, but I think the library might work there.

```
pip install eadator
```
or
```
easy_install eadator
```

or
```
pip install git+git://github.com/eadhost/eadator.git
```

Requires `libxml2` for `lxml` and validation.  

This utility performs a universial EAD2002 validation.  It exits
EXIT_SUCCESS (0)  with no output if the file is a valid EAD2002.
Relevent validation error messages are displaied and the scripts
exits EXIT_FAILURE (1) if the file is not valid with respect to its
intended type (XSD or DTD).

EAD2002 has a DTD version and an XSD version which are not compatible.
Firstly, they are in different namespaces.  The DTD version is in
the default xml namespace, and the XSD version is in
`urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9` -- this fact is used to determine if DTD
or XSD validation should be used for validation.  There are other minor differences
in xlink namespaces and in the letter case of xlink attributes.

```
usage: eadator [-h] [--dtd DTD] [--xsd XSD] eadfile

EAD validator

positional arguments:
  eadfile     EAD XML file to check

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --dtd DTD
  --xsd XSD
```

Comes with default `ead.dtd` and `ead.xsd`, but you can point at
your own copies on the local filesystem or at URLs on the web.
